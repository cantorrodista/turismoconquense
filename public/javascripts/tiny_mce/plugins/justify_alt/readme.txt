# Plugin: Justify Alt

The Justify Alt plugin converts the style information added by the justify buttons of the advanced theme to class attributes.

In addition, avoids the use of the justify buttons to float images.
  
This plugin was developed by Choan GÃ¡lvez in April, 2008. Paid by The Cocktail.
